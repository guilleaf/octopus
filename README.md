Instructions to compile octopus as a normal user
================================================

This document provides a step-by-step guide about how to compile octopus, most of its dependencies using the intel compiler.
The idea of this more than follow a recipe is to understand how to install a typical large ab-initio code the rellies on
several other libraries usually not present on the machine where you plan to compute and where you do not have superuser access to
install the code on the root '/' directory.
